# Truck Signs API - Docker setup

This guide explains how the Truck Sign Shop Django application is containerised and run alongside a PostgreSQL database using Docker only. Each service runs in its own container, and communication is handled via a cutom Docker network.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**  

---

## Quickstart

1. Clone the Repository and Enter the Project Directory

Start by cloning the project repository and enter the main directory: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e1pmiS/truck_signs_api.git
cd truck_signs_api
```
2. Network configutration

Create a custom Docker network called "ts_net" or other name to enable communication between your containers:

```bash
docker network create ts_net
```

When running your containers, attach them to this network using the --network option. Containers on the same network can communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.

3. Set Up Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration. A example file example.env is provided. Copy the sample file to create your own .env file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```
then open the .env file and update any variables as needed, such as database credentials or your Django SECRET_KEY.

ðŸ’¡ If you donâ€™t have a SECRET_KEY, see section [Generating a Django SECRET_KEY](#generating-a-django-secret_key) for instructions on how to create one securely.


4. Start PostgreSQL Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name trucksigns_db \
  --network ts_net \
  --env-file truck_signs_designs/settings/.env \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:15
```
This exposes PostgreSQL on port 5433 of the host machine.

5. Build the Application Image

```bash
docker build -t trucksigns_app:latest .
```
6. Run the Application Container

```bash
docker run -it --network ts_net --restart=on-failure -p 8020:8000 trucksigns_app:latest
```

After Step 4,the Truck Sign Shop application will be running inside a Docker container and accessible on the port 8020 of the host machine and the container will restart once an error accured.

## Usage

### Generating a Django SECRET_KEY

A secure SECRET_KEY is essential for the security of your Django application. You can generate one using Python directly from your terminal.

Run the following command:

```bash
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```

This will output a secure, random string you can use as your SECRET_KEY.

### Django Superuser Creation on Container Start

Upon starting the Django application container, a prompt will appear requesting the following details for superuser creation:

* Username

* Email address

* Password

The container should be run as indicated in the Quickstart section, and the prompts in the containerâ€™s terminal should be followed to complete the admin user setup.

### Logging into Django Admin and Managing Products

you can log in and start managing the shop.

1. Open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://<host_ip>:8020/admin
```

2. Log in using the superuser credentials you just created.

3. In the Django admin dashboard, you can:

* Add Categories

* Add Products under specific categories

* Edit or delete existing items

### External Deployment

To publish the server externally, you need to configure Django to allow requests from your external IP address or domain.

Open your [base.py](truck_signs_designs/settings/base.py) file and find the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting. Add your server's IP address or domain name:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [<your_server_ip_address>, 'localhost']
```
